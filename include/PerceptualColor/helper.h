/** @mainpage
 * This library provides various Qt GUI components for choosing colors, with
 * focus on an intuitive and perceptually uniform presentation. The GUI
 * widgets are based internally on the LCh color model, which does reflect
 * the human perceptuan much better than RGB or its transforms like HSV.
 * However, the widgets do not require the user itself to know anything
 * about LCh at all, because the graphical representations is
 * intuitive enough. This library lives in the namespace #PerceptualColor.
 * 
 * How to get started? @ref PerceptualColor::ColorDialog provides a perceptual
 * replacement for QColorDialog:
 * @snippet test/testcolordialog.cpp ColorDialog Get color
 * 
 * And there are also individual widgets available. Among others:
 * - @ref PerceptualColor::WheelColorPicker (a full-featureed color wheel)
 * - @ref PerceptualColor::ColorPatch (to show a particular color)
 * - @ref PerceptualColor::ChromaHueDiagram (for selecting colors at a given
 *   lightness)
 * 
 * The library depends on (and therefore you has to link
 * against) <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt</a>Â 5 (only the modules
 * QtÂ Core, QtÂ Gui and QtÂ Widgets are necessary) and
 * <a href="http://www.littlecms.com/">LittleCMSÂ 2</a>.
 * 
 * The library uses in general @c int for integer values, because @c QSize()
 * and @c QPoint() also do. As the library relies heavily on the usage of
 * @c QSize() and @c QPoint(), this seems reasonable. For the same reason, it
 * uses generally @c qreal for floating point values, because @c QPointF()
 * also does. Output colors that are shown on the screen, are usually
 * 8-bit-per-channel colors. For internal transformation, usually @c qreal
 * is used for each channel, giving a better precision and reducing rounding
 * errors.
 * 
 * The source code of the library is in UTF8. A static_assert within the
 * header @ref helper.h makes sure your compiler actually treats it as UTF8. */

 * necessary.
 * @todo Switch to the pimpl ideom?
 * @todo Qt Designer support for the widgets
 * @todo QPainter: Quote from documentation: For optimal performance only use
 * the format types @c QImage::Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied,
 * @c QImage::Format_RGB32 or @c QImage::Format_RGB16. Any other format,
 * including @c QImage::Format_ARGB32, has significantly worse performance.
 * @todo Follow KDE's <b><a href="https://hig.kde.org/index.html">HIG</a></b>

     * German Wikipedia</a>, the Lab color space has the following ranges:
     * 
     * | Lab axis  | Usual software implementation | Actual human perception |
     * | :-------- | ----------------------------: | ----------------------: |
     * | lightness |                        0..100 |                   0â€¥100 |
     * | a         |                      âˆ’128â€¥127 |                âˆ’170â€¥100 |
     * | b         |                      âˆ’128â€¥127 |                âˆ’100â€¥150 |
     * 
     * The range of âˆ’128â€¥127 is in C++ a signed 8â€‘bitÂ integer. But this
     * data type usually used in software implementations is (as the table
     * clearly shows) not enough to cover the hole range of actual human color
     * perception.
     *
     * Unfortunately, there is no information about the LCh color space. But
     * we can deduce:
     * - @b Lightness: Same range as for Lab: <b>0â€¥100</b>
     * - @b Chroma: The Chroma value is the distance from the center of the
     *   coordinate system in the aâ€‘bâ€‘plane. Therefore it cannot be bigger
     *   than Pythagoras of the biggest possible absolute value on aÂ axis and
     *   bÂ axis: âˆš[(âˆ’170)Â²Â +Â 150Â²]Â â‰ˆÂ 227. Very likely the real range is
     *   smaller, but we do not know exactly how much. At least, we can be
     *   sure that this range is big enough: <b>0â€¥227</b>
     * - @b Hue: As the angle in a polar coordinate system, it has to
     *   be: <b>0Â°â€¥360Â°</b>
     * 
     * But what could be useful default values? This struct provides some
