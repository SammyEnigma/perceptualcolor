/** @brief The namespace of this library.
 * 
 * Everything that is provides in this library is encapsulated within this
 * namespace.
 * 
 * The library provides various Qt GUI components for choosing colors, with
 * focus on an intuitive and perceptually uniform presentation. The GUI
 * widgets are based internally on the LCh color model, which does reflect
 * the human perceptuan much better than RGB or its transforms like HSV.
 * However, the widgets do not require the user itself to know anything
 * about LCh at all, because the graphical representations tend to be
 * intuitive enough.
 * 
 * The library depends on (and therefore you have to link against) QtÂ Core,
 * QtÂ Gui, QtÂ Widgets (QtÂ 5) and LittleCMSÂ 2.
 * 
 * The library uses in general @c int for integer values, because QSize() and
 * QPoint() also do. As the library relies heavily on the usage of QSize()
 * and QPoint(), this seems reasonable. For the same reason, it uses generally
 * @c qreal for floating point values, because QPointF() also does.
 * 
 * The source code of the library is in UTF8. A static_assert within the
 * header @c helper.h makes sure your compiler actually treats it as UTF8.
 * 
 * @todo Translations: Color picker/Select Color â†’ FarbwÃ¤hler/Farbauswahl etcâ€¦
 * @todo Does the OS-side color management change the RGB value we want to
 * display? If so, how to prevent this?
 * @todo Only expose in the headers and in the public API what is absolutely
 * necessary.
 * @todo Switch to the pimpl ideom?
 * @todo Qt Designer support for the widgets */

     * <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lab-Farbraum&oldid=197156292">
     * German Wikipedia</a>, the Lab color space has the following ranges:
     * 
     * | Lab axis  | Usual software implementation | Actual human perception |
     * | :-------- | ----------------------------: | ----------------------: |
     * | lightness |                        0..100 |                   0â€¥100 |
     * | a         |                      âˆ’128â€¥127 |                âˆ’170â€¥100 |
     * | b         |                      âˆ’128â€¥127 |                âˆ’100â€¥150 |
     * 
     * The range of âˆ’128â€¥127 is in C++ a signed 8â€‘bitÂ integer. But this
     * data type usually used in software implementations is obviously not
     * enough to cover the hole range of actual human color perception.
     *
     * Unfortunately, there is no information about the LCh color space. But
     * we can deduce:
     * - @b Lightness: Same range as for Lab: <b>0â€¥100</b>
     * - @b Chroma: The Chroma value is the distance from the center of the
     *   coordinate system in the aâ€‘bâ€‘plane. Therefore it cannot be bigger
     *   than Pythagoras of the biggest possible absolute value on aÂ axis and
     *   bÂ axis: âˆš[(âˆ’170)Â²Â +Â 150Â²]Â â‰ˆÂ 227. Very likely the real range is
     *   smaller, but we do not know exactly how much. At least, we can be
     *   sure that this range is big enough: <b>0â€¥227</b>
     * - @b Hue: As the angle in a polar coordinate system, it has to
     *   be: <b>0Â°â€¥360Â°</b>
     * 
     * But what could be useful default values? This struct provides some
