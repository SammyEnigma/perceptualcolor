/** @brief Base class for circular diagrams.
 * 
 * Provides some elements that are common for all circular diagrams in this
 * library. 
 * 
 * As the natural interaction space of these diagrams is a circle, itâ€™s best
 * to have equal <tt>width()</tt> and <tt>height()</tt> for the widget. This
 * class provides the corresponding implementations to notify the layout
 * manager about that. See @ref hasHeightForWidth and @ref heightForWidth for
 * details.
 *
 * The default size policy is <tt>QSizePolicy::Expanding</tt>, both
 * horizontally and vertically.
 * 
 * In Qt, usually focus (<tt>QWidget::hasFocus()</tt>) by mouse click is
 * either not accepted at all or accepted always for the hole rectangular
 * widget, depending on <tt>QWidget::focusPolicy()</tt>. This is not
 * convenient and intuitive for big, circular-shaped widgets like this one.
 * It would be nicer if the focus would only be accepted by mouse clicks
 * <em>within the circle itself</em>. Qt does not provide a build-in way to
 * do this. But a workaround to implement this behavior is possible: Set
 * <tt>QWidget::focusPolicy()</tt> to <em>not</em> accept focus by mouse
 * click. Then, reimplement <tt>mousePressEvent()</tt> and call
 * <tt>setFocus(Qt::MouseFocusReason)</tt> if the mouse click is within the
 * circle. Therefore, this class simply defaults to
 * <tt>Qt::FocusPolicy::TabFocus</tt> for <tt>QWidget::focusPolicy()</tt>. But
 * it is up to child classes to actually reimplement
 * <tt>mousePressEvent()</tt> accordingly. */
