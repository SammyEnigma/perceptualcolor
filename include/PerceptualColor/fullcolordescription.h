/** @brief A fully qualified color.
 * 
 * This is similar to QColor, but contains both Lab color space
 * representations and RGB color space representations. The constructor takes
 * an RgbColorSpace() object to assure color management. Once constructed,
 * the object cannot be modified anymore (except the alpha value, which does
 * not depend on color management).
 * 
 * Contains an RGB, LCh and Lab representation of the color and the alpha
 * channel. The data types are compatible with LittleCMS. The LCh value is
 * normalized.
 * 
 * This class is declared as type to Qt's type system:
 * <tt>Q_DECLARE_METATYPE(PerceptualColor::FullColorDescription)</tt>.
 * Depending on your use case (for example if you want to use it
 * reliably in Qt's signals and slots), you might consider calling
 * <tt>qRegisterMetaType()</tt> for this type, once you have a QApplication
 * object.
 * 
 * This data type can be passed to QDebug thanks to
 * operator<<(QDebug dbg, const PerceptualColor::FullColorDescription &value)
 * 
 * @todo Conversion HSV-RGB with Qtâ€™s QColor: Can we get a higher precison
 * with our own implementation?
 * 
 * @todo This class is rather a data type than a functional class. Currently,
 * it does not provide pimpl idiom. And: It is copyable and <tt>final</tt>.
 * Should it be switched to pimpl or not? Pimpl would be bad for performance,
 * which matters as this class will get instanciated a lot. On the other
 * hand, this class has often changed during code development and is not
 * stable, which is quite a risk if we to not have pimpl.
 * 
 * @todo TODO What if an API user sets a FullColorDescription property
 * within a widget, but widget and FullColorDescription are
 * based on different color spaces? Display would be wrong! Or not? */
