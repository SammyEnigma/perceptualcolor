 * - If you set the <tt>QWidget::focusPolicy</tt> property to a
 *   value that does not accept focus by mouse click, the focus
 *   will nevertheless be accepted for clicks within the actual circle.
 *   (This is the default behavior.)
 * - If you set the <tt>QWidget::focusPolicy</tt> property to a
 *   value that accepts focus by mouse click, the focus will not only be
 *   accepted for clicks within the actual circle, but also for clicks
 *   anyware within the (rectangular) widget.

 * Add support for Qt::MouseButton::ForwardButton?
